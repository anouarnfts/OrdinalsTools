Disclaimer: I have not checked any info and everything is scrapped from OrdinalsDirectory.

This is an updated version of collections in https://ordinalsdirectory.com/. Credit to them:

OrdinalsDirectory Twitter: https://twitter.com/OrdDirectory

OrdinalsDirectory Discord: https://discord.gg/t7AEzHua3Y

The idea is to check if your inscription is legit and it belongs to any collection. You can search your Inscription hash 
and check if it's associated to any collection or it's a fake inscription using [The Ordinals Directory Table](OrdinalsDirectoryIndex.md).

Once you checked that you inscription belongs to any collection you have that collection with images in https://ordinalsdirectory.com.
